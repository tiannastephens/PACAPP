## ➪ Introduction

We all have those days when we start to feel overwhelmed because of the amount of work we need to get done in such little time, which could cause us to become disorganized and frustrated. This web application is a great way to help users plan, create and organize their day-to-day tasks; however, this program can’t be used to set reminders, and is only a virtual planner. The PAC App will even allow the users to set their own goals so that they can be met in a timely matter. 

### Plan

_Let’s Create Your Plan_ _

The PAC App will give the user a set list of different types of plans they can choose from depending on what the user wants to use in order to meet their needs. The set list can be seen shown below:

#### PLAN TYPES

**•	TASKS & ERRANDS (T&E)**  – using this plan gives the user the option to create a title or use automatic titles such as: (Grocery shopping, Car maintenance, Hair appointments, Pet Care, Work and School). Once a title has been made or selected the user can now type in a description explaining what that task or errand is being created for and choose what date they want to execute that plan. 

**•	EVENT (EV)** -   With this plan the user also has the option to create a title or use automatic titles such as: (Birthdays, Meetings, Games, Weddings). Once a title has been made or selected for this task the user has the option to either add a description or continue to the calendar and select a date for the newly created event.

**•	GOAL (G)** - this plan type will automatically require the user to create their own title. Once the title has been selected the user add in their own words a description of this goal. After that there will be a tab that will ask the user (“How do you plan on reaching this goal?”) and the user must answer this question in order to continue to the calendar.  From here the user can select a Start date and a date on which they wish this goal to be achieved and select create.

**•	ROUTINE (RT)** - using this plan gives the user the option to create a title or use automatic titles such as: (work out, study, chores, pet care, self-care, work). Once a title has been made or selected the user can now type in a description that they want to use for the title and a Starting and Stopping point date. 

The PAC App is very easy and simple to use; Although each plan is different, they ultimately work the same way when it comes to selecting a Title, Description & Calendar Date. 

#### Length of Plan types

When selecting a (“Start & End Date”) the user will be given the option to either choose a single day, a weekly, monthly or yearly plan. Each plan a user creates MUST have a (Start & End Date). The calendar will mark the desired finish date as “completed” on the following day for every plan type whether these are single day, weekly, monthly or yearly plans. 

#### Account Info

Users must create an account in order to use the PAC Web Application. When registering for an account the user will be asked to create Username and Password, enter their birthdate and an email address for account verification. 

_Info Stored_ 

The PAC App will store the user’s plans as shown in the examples below:
